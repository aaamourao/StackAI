# StackAI

## What is **StackAI**?

**StackAI** project intends to use machine learning approaches to find out patterns and make predictions on [StackExchange dumped data](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange). So far, the target outputs are:

* Predict how many up/down votes a question is going to get after a given time interval
* Predict when a question is going to be answered
* Predict if a post is going to be blocked or removed

#### Current status

First, a proof of concept will be implemented using open machine learning libraries, just like TensorFlow and Numpy. After that, a Python API will be developed for the awesome [Gneural Network](https://www.gnu.org/software/gneuralnetwork/), which is currently on its early versions.

#### Current version 0.0.1
* Django apps created
* Models for data handling
